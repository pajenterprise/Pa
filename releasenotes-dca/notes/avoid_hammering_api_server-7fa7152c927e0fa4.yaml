# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    When a new node starts, the DCA might receive Kubernetes events before the API server can GET it.
    In this case, the DCA will keep on querying the API server for each event it receives until it succeeds.
    In order to not hammer the API server, the DCA will now query the API server to get the node info at most once every minutes per node.
