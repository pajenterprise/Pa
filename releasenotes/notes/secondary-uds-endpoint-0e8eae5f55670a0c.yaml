    Adding a secondary endpoint to DogStatsD dedicated to telemetry metrics.
    This is useful in high throughput scenarios to avoid dropping telemetry
    metrics which prevents users from troubleshooting issues. The new option is
    "dogstatsd_telemetry_listener", supports UDS/UDP and is disabled by default.
    This also requires the DogStatsD client to send telemetry to a custom
    endpoint, see the clients documentation for more details.
