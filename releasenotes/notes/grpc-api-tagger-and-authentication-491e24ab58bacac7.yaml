# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add binary, more performant tagger gRPC service endpoint.
  - |
    gRPC authenticated service endpoints are now available,
    including the tagger endpoint. Authentication enforced
    by means of a bearer token. Existing gRPC endpoints that
    required no authentication are still valid.
