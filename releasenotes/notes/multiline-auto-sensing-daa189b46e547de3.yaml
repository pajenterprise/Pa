# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add multi-line auto-sensing when tailing logs from file.
    It checks for the n first lines when tailing for a know list
    of timestamp format. If all lines match one of the know
    timestamp format it switches to the MultiLineHandler with
    the regexp matching the timestamp format.
    New global config parameter: ``logs_config.disable_auto_multi_line``
    to disable the feature globally.
    New per log integration config parameters:
    * ``disable_auto_multi_line`` to disable the feature on a case
      by case basis
    * ``auto_multi_line_sample_size`` the number of lines to check
